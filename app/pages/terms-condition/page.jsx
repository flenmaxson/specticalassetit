  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">Last Updated: November 21, 2023</p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">AGREEMENT TO TERMS</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms and Conditions constitute a legally binding agreement governing your access to and use of the <a href="https://specticalassetit.com" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">https://specticalassetit.com</a> website, along with any related media form, media channel, mobile website, or mobile application connected thereto (collectively referred to as the “Site”). This agreement is entered into between you, whether individually or on behalf of an entity (“you”), and Spectical Asset (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).
  </p>
  <p>
    The Site provides computer assistance services and related digital solutions as part of its online marketplace offerings (the “Marketplace Offerings”). All users are required to accept and comply with these Terms of Use, including any supplemental policies or user agreements posted on the Site, which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. By accessing or using the Site or the Marketplace Offerings, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be legally bound by these Terms of Use.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you do not agree with all of the terms outlined herein, you are expressly prohibited from using the Site and the Marketplace Offerings and must discontinue use immediately.

    We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or update these Terms of Use at any time and for any reason. You waive any right to receive individual notice of such changes, and acknowledge that updates will be reflected by revising the “Last Updated” date. Continued use of the Site following the posting of revised Terms constitutes acceptance of those changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    All users must be at least 18 years of age. Individuals under the age of 18 are not permitted to access, register, or use the Site or Marketplace Offerings.
